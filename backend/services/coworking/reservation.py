        for each room. Statuses are integers representing:

        the date queried.
        - The total number of time slots (`number_of_time_slots`) available within the operating hours,
        based on 30-minute intervals.

        It handles various scenarios including days without operating hours by providing a default schedule
        (10 am to 6 pm) and adjusting time slots based on current time to mark past slots as unavailable.
        It supports rounding start and end times to the nearest half-hour and excludes reservations that
