"""User authentication over HTTP via Headers and/or HTTP JWT Bearer Tokens.

This module provides a `registered_user` dependency injection function for other routes
to use to both ensure a user is authenticated and resolve to the logged in User's model.
Further, this module provides the routes and logic for backend authentication.

The router is mounted at `/auth` and provides the following endpoints:

    /auth
        Redirects to the authentication server to authenticate the user.

    /auth/as/{uid}/{pid}
        Redirects to the authentication server to authenticate the user as
        another user. This route is only available in development mode.

    /auth/verify
        Verifies the validity of a JWT token and returns the decoded token. This is
        the end-point a development/staging server requests of the production server
        to verify the legitimacy of delegated authentication.

The implementation of auth routes are nuanced due to UNC Cloud Apps' Single Sign-On (SSO)
proxy service. In production, there is a proxy sitting in front of the app that
integrates with UNC's SSO/Shibboleth service for authentication. For more information
on this proxy service, see the [official CloudApps documentation](https://help.unc.edu/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011256)

In production, the proxy intercepts all routes prefixed with `/auth`. Two paths follow:

1. If the user is not logged in, the proxy redirects the user to the authentication server.
2. If the user is logged in, the proxy sets the `uid` and `pid` headers to the user's
    Onyen and PID, respectively, and forwards the request to our app.

Once the request is forwarded to our app server, the `uid` and `pid` headers are used to
generate a JWT token and persist it in the client's local storage via a the _set_client_token
function. The frontend client code then uses this token, via JwtToken imported in AppModule,
to set the HTTP Authorization header on all subsequent API requests thanks to the @auth0/angular-jwt
library's [HTTP Interceptor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@auth0/angular-jwt).

In development, the proxy is not present. Instead, there are two options for authentication:

1. If an unauthenticated user visits /auth in development, or staging, they are redirected
   to the production `csxl.unc.edu/auth` route with an additional query parameter `origin`.
    A. The production server authentication works as usual, but if the `origin` parameter is
       detected alongside the SSO headers, the user will be redirected back to the `origin` 
       server with a JWT `token` query parameter. This token is signed by the production server.
    B. Back on the development/staging server, we need to verify that the token given to the route
       was actually signed by the production server. If we did not do this, a malicious user could
       simply generate a token and pass it to the development server to gain access. Thus, an HTTP
       request from the development/stage server is made to the production server's `/auth/verify` route
       to verify the token's validity. If the token is valid, the development/staging server then 
       issues a new `token` to the client that is signed by the development/staging server. 
       This token is then used for all subsequent requests.
2. If an unauthenticated user visits /auth/as/{uid}/{pid} in development, they are authenticated
    as the user with the given `uid` and `pid`, which are their ONYEN and PID, respectively. 
    This route is only available in development mode.

Finally, the `authenticated_pid` function ensures a user is authenticated with PID and Onyen, 
but does not require that the user be registered in the database. This is only really useful 
for routes used in the process of registering a user.
