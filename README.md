## Overview

The primary goal of the CSXL Student Organizations and Events feature is to allow UNC CS students to **explore all CS organizations on campus**, **view upcoming events** hosted by these organizations, **join organizations and events**, and **catalog events** attended in the past.

In addition, this feature should allow administrators of CS organizations to *edit their organization profile*, *add events their organization plans to host*, and *view members who sign up to attend*.

This feature would also **help to standarize the CS organization events system** so students, organization administrators, and CSXL administrators can *keep track of organization membership, event interest, and event attendance*.
