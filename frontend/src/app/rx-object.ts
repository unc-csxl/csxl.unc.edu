/**
 * Abstract base class for "Reactive Objects", an XL App pattern for interactive objects.
 * These objects are typically models whose data is loaded from the backend API and whose
 * state is mutable via user interactions with the object.
 *
 * Extended classes add methods to update the object `value`, or properties of it,
 * and call the `notify()` method which pushes an update to all `value$` subscribers.
 * By design, set and the `value$` observable are only publicly exposed members of `RxObject`.
 *
 * For subclass implementers, the general strategy is to treat the protected member `value`
 * as the most recent value of the object, mutate it or replace it as necessary during
 * an implemented method's operation, and then **be sure to call notify()* so that dependent
 * subscribers to this object (typically views/UI) are updated to reflect.
