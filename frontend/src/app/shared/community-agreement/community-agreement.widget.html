    <p>
      The Undergraduate Experience Labs (XL) community serves the Computer
      Science Undergraduate Community at UNC-Chapel Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive
      experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression,
      sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance,
      body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion, or other protected
      category. These policies are inspired by and almost entirely replicate

    </p>
    <p>
      We do not tolerate harassment of XL community members in any form. We take
      violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
      All participants of the XL in-person and on-line communities, XL
      ambassadors, XL staff, speakers, faculty, and participants otherwise, must
      agree to and abide by the following policies in order to access XL's
      events, online communities, and facilities.
    </p>
    <h3>I agree to be respectful to everyone in the XL community.</h3>
    <p>
      I agree to treat everyone with respect. I will participate while
      acknowledging everyone deserves to be here - and every one has the right
      to enjoy their experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or
      condescension, whether blatant or micro-aggressions. All forms of
      communication should not demean others. Consider what you are saying and
      how it would feel if it were said to you or about you.

      Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when
      you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable
      may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their
      behavior to their attention is encouraged.

      I understand for this space to remain open to undergraduate students, I
      need to prove to faculty and administration I will take care of it.

    <p>
      Some faculty do not believe our undergraduate community is capable of
      taking care of a space with top-of-the-line chairs, monitors, desks, and
      so on. The XL staff, ambassadors, and Professor Jordan know our community
      are capable, but it's on you and everyone to prove it.

      Over $80,000 of furniture was bought new for the space this year, please
      treat it like you bought it.
