      Agreement

    <p>
      The Undergraduate Experience Labs (XL) community serves the Computer
      Science Undergraduate Community at UNC-Chapel Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive
      experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression,
      sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance,
      body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion, or other protected
      category. These policies are inspired by and almost entirely replicate
      Google's Developer Community Guidelines:
      https://developers.google.com/community-guidelines
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not tolerate harassment of XL community members in any form. We take
      violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
      All participants of the XL in-person and on-line communities, XL
      ambassadors, XL staff, speakers, faculty, and participants otherwise, must
      agree to and abide by the following policies in order to access XL's
      events, online communities, and facilities.
    </p>
    <h3>I agree to be respectful to everyone in the XL community.</h3>
    <p>
      I agree to treat everyone with respect. I will participate while
      acknowledging everyone deserves to be here - and every one has the right
      to enjoy their experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or
      condescension, whether blatant or micro-aggressions. All forms of
      communication should not demean others. Consider what you are saying and
      how it would feel if it were said to you or about you.
    </p>
    <h3>I agree to speak up if I see or hear something amiss.</h3>
    <p>
      Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when
      you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable
      may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their
      behavior to their attention is encouraged.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I agree to abide by the XL Community's ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY for in-person
      or online harassment of any kind.

    <h3>
      When asked to stop any harassing behavior, I will comply immediately.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
      immediately. Our zero tolerance policy means that we will look into and
      review every allegation of violation of our Event Community Guidelines and
      Anti-Harassment Policy and respond appropriately.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I will report any behavior that makes me or others feel uncomfortable.
    </h3>
    <p>
      {{
        'To report any behavior that makes you or others feel uncomfortable, visit the XL website (csxl.unc.edu) or email kris@cs.unc.edu to file a report.'
      }}
    </p>
    <h3>I understand this policy extends to all XL activities.</h3>
    <p>
      This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social media,
      all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, staff, etc. You catch our
      drift. The XL reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any
      person from, any XL hosted event (including future XL events) at any time
      in its sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This includes, but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a disorderly
      manner or failing to comply with this policy, and the terms and conditions
      herein. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior,
      the XL staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
      or expelling the offender from the event or space.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I agree to take care of the XL spaces and equipment and to leave
      everything as clean, or cleaner, as before my usage.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our community expects a high degree of cleanliness and tidiness in its
      spaces such that everyone in our community can expect a fresh, welcoming,
      and productive environment at all times.
    </p>
    <p>This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Promptly and fully cleaning up any spills or accidents</li>
      <li>Properly disposing of all trash and recyclables</li>
      <li>Pushing chairs in after usage</li>
      <li>
        Resetting the room to its starting point after any temporary changes
      </li>
      <li>Erasing whiteboards</li>
      <li>Not doing anything destructive</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      I understand for this space to remain open to undergraduate students, I
      need to prove to faculty and administration I will take care of it.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some faculty do not believe our undergraduate community is capable of
      taking care of a space with top-of-the-line chairs, monitors, desks, and
      so on. The XL staff, ambassadors, and Professor Jordan know our community
      are capable, but it's on you and everyone to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over $80,000 of furniture was bought new for the space this year, please
      treat it like you bought it.
    </p>
    <h3>Eat in the Lounge Area (SN142 or SN Lobby)</h3>
    <p>
      In order to keep the equipment and facilities of the XL as clean as
      possible, and avoid the disruptive smells of delicious food while others
      are working, if you bring food to eat in Sitterson please eat in the
      lounge area just outside of the XL (SN142) or in the Sitterson Lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not eat food or have open drinking containers in the workstation spaces
      with 2nd monitors in the XL.
    </p>
    <h3>The XL is Not for Gaming - Please Use the Craige E-Sports Arena</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of the XL is to serve as a community coworking, productivity,
      and professional development space for the CS Community. If you would like
      to play games with groups of friends, please do so in the Craige Gaming
      Arena (https://carolinagaming.unc.edu/directions-parking/) or elsewhere on
      campus. If you are playing games in the workstation monitor space, you
      will be asked to stop and/or take the gameplay elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I understand my access to the XL will be suspended if I leave messes
      behind, eat in the XL, fail to clean up after myself, destroy, damage
      property of the XL, or otherwise act outside the community's standards.
