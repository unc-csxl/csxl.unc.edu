This document outlines the technical specifications for the Open Hours Editor feature of the CSXL web application. This feature adds functionality to manage open hours directly through a user-friendly interface, improving administrative efficiency. The project introduces several new frontend components and utilizes existing API routes with minimal modifications to achieve its goals.

## Overview<a name="overview"></a>

The Open Hours Editor provides a calendar-based interface for administrators to add, edit, and manage the open hours of the CSXL. This feature enhances usability by offering visual scheduling tools while maintaining consistency with existing site design.

---

## New/Modified Model Representations and API Routes<a name="models-and-api"></a>

- **API Route**:  
  A new `PUT` operation was added to edit open hours (`/api/openhours/edit`).

- **Models**:  
  Two new models were created:

  - `OperatingHoursRecurrenceDraft`: Represents a draft version of the recurrence for a single set of Operating Hours, used for creation and editing.
  - `OperatingHoursRecurrenceJSON`: Handles JSON serialization for operating hour recurrence drafts.
  - `OperatingHoursRecurrence`: Represents a the recurrence for a single set of Operating Hours.
  - `OperatingHoursRecurrenceJSON`: Handles JSON serialization for operating hour recurrence.
  - `OperatingHoursDraft`: Represents a draft version of a single set of Operating Hours, used for creation and editing.
  - `OperatingHoursDraftJSON`: Handles JSON serialization for operating hours drafts.

- **Helper Methods**:
  - `parseOperatingHoursJSONArray`: Processes JSON data for an array of Operating Hours from the backend for frontend compatibility.
  - `parseRecurrenceJSON`: Processes JSON data for Operating Hours recurrence from the backend for frontend compatibility.

---

## Database/Entity-Level Representation Decisions<a name="database-decisions"></a>

We added a new `recurrence_id` to `OperatingHoursEntity`, which refers to the new `OperatingHoursRecurrenceEntity`.

The `OperatingHoursRecurrenceEntity` entity is used to track recurrence information, holding the end date and recurrence pattern for a recurrence.

---

## Technical Design Choices<a name="technical-design"></a>

1. **Recurrence as Generated Hours Connected by ID**:

   - We implemented recurrence by creating the hours at modification-time in order to take advantage of pre-existing systems for getting a schedule and identifying Operating Hours by ID.
   - We considered generating hours when the user requested a schedule based on a collection of recurrences, however we decided against it due to anticipated difficulties selecting hours.

2. **Maintaining Recurrence Connection Over Gaps**

   - We decided to make sure that we maintained existing recurrence relationships between Operating Hours even when hours in the middle get deleted.
   - This was done since the update system had support for gaps in the recurrence and breaking the relationships can harm the user experience.

---

## User Experience Design Choices<a name="ux-design"></a>

1. **Hidden Panels for Add/Edit Hours**:

   - The Add/Edit actions are handled through a panel that only shows while adding or editing, keeping the main calendar view uncluttered.

2. **Simplified Calendar View**:

   - The calendar normally only displays Monday through Friday and hours from 8 AM to 10 PM, reflecting current CSXL operating hours.

3. **Dynamic Calendar Adjustments**:

   - The calendar adjusts dynamically to display scheduled hours even if they fall outside the typical 8 AMâ€“10 PM range.

4. **Sidebar Editing**:

   - A sidebar was chosen for editing hours, allowing users to see the full calendar while managing operating hours.

5. **Highlighting Selected Hour Blocks**:
   - The selected hour block changes color during editing, providing clear visual feedback to the user.

---

## Design Trade-Offs<a name="trade-offs"></a>

### User Experience Design Trade-Off: Sidebar vs. Persistent Panel

- **Decision**: We implemented a pop-up sidebar for editing instead of a persistent panel.
- **Reasoning**: The sidebar ensures the UI remains uncluttered, while allowing administrators to view the calendar as they manage open hours.
- **Trade-Off**: A persistent panel would have streamlined the workflow slightly but at the cost of reduced calendar visibility.

### User Experience Design Trade-Off: Sidebar vs. Pop-Up

- **Decision**: We implemented adding and edditing as a sidebar instead of a pop-up.
- **Reasoning**: The sidebar leaves the administrator's view of the calendar unobstructed while adding and editing.
- **Trade-Off**: A pop-up would have likely been more mobile-friendly at the cost of reduced calendar visibility.

### User Experience Design Trade-Off: Add Hours Button vs. Direct Calendar Interaction

- **Decision**: We opted for an "Add Hours" button instead of direct calendar interaction for adding hours.
- **Reasoning**: The button simplifies interactions and prevents accidental scheduling errors.
- **Trade-Off**: While direct calendar interaction would be faster for experienced users, it could confuse new users and increase UI complexity.

### Technical Design Trade-Off: Generating Recurrence at Modification-Time vs. User Request-Time

- **Decision**: We decided to generate recurring events when the administration creates/updates them instead of when the user requests a schedule.
- **Reasoning**: This simplifies selecting hours and viewing schedules, and the main benefit of request-time generation is unlikely to be used much.
- **Trade-Off**: Creating hours when the user requests a schedule would allow for recurrence without a defined end date, and could in theory reduce storage usage.

## Development Concerns<a name="development-concerns"></a>

1. **Frontend Components**:

   - **`frontend/src/app/coworking/coworking-home/coworking-home.component.ts`**:  
     Contains the gear button that grants access to the Open Hours Calendar Editor.

   - **`frontend/src/app/coworking/coworking-admin folder`**:  
     Houses the main calendar component and related files, including:

     - `coworking-admin.component.ts` (logic and routing)
     - `coworking-admin.component.html` (template for the calendar view)
     - `coworking-admin.component.css` (styling for the calendar page).

   - **`frontend/src/app/shared/operating-hours-calendar folder`**:  
     Contains the reusable `OperatingHoursCalendar` component, which dynamically renders the calendar and applies styling.

2. **Backend CRUD Operations**:

   - **`backend/services/coworking/operating_hours.py`**:
     - Created a new `update` method to communicate with the PostgreSQL database and update the OperatingHours entity.
   - **`backend/api/coworking/operating_hours.py`**:
     - Created a new API route for editing operating hours

3. **Dynamic Calendar Styling**:
   - The grid layout for the calendar is dynamically generated within the HTML and styled via CSS.
   - Many of the styles are generated in the html to allow for dynamic changes(creating the grid based on the number of days/hours we want to show)

## Future Considerations<a name="future-considerations"></a>

1. **Direct Calendar Interaction**:

   - Enable users to click directly on a day to add hours, complementing the "Add Hours" button.

2. **Mobile Optimization**:

   - Refactor components to improve mobile usability, including touch-friendly interactions.

3. **Expanded Time Range**:

   - Consider extending calendar hours and days for special events or unique schedules.

4. **Enhanced Styling**:

   - Incorporate additional visual cues and animations to improve accessibility and aesthetics.

5. **Historical Rescheduling**:

   - Allow admins to copy historical schedules to the present.

6. **Prevent Editing the Past**:

   - Prevent admins from editing/deleting hours that have already passed.

7. **Better Error Messaging**:
   - Give users better error messages when their creation/updates are rejected due to overlaps, as they are currently 500 errors.
